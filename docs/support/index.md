# Support

If you have issues with the engine, make sure you're using the latest available version. You can update the core package using Unity Asset Store interface: `Window -> Asset Store`. In case you're using any of the engine extensions, download the latest packages using following links:

- [NaninovelLive2D](https://github.com/Elringus/NaninovelLive2D/raw/master/NaninovelLive2D.unitypackage)
- [NaninovelSpriteDicing](https://github.com/Elringus/NaninovelSpriteDicing/raw/master/NaninovelSpriteDicing.unitypackage)
- [NaninovelTMPro](https://github.com/Elringus/NaninovelTMPro/raw/master/NaninovelTMPro.unitypackage)

If updating didn't help, try to re-install the package by deleting `Naninovel` folder from the project and re-importing it from the Asset Store. Be aware that by deleting the package folder you'll lose all the engine configuration data; you can keep the configuration by migrating `Naninovel/Resources/Naninovel/Configuration` folder to the new package installation folder. 

Always remember to backup your project (or use a [VCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control)) before updating or deleting a package. ~~Haruhi~~ God knows what could happen in the process.
