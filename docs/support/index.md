# Support

If you have issues with the engine, make sure you're using the latest available version. You can update the package using Unity Asset Store interface: `Window -> Asset Store`. 

If updating didn't help, try to re-install the package by deleting `Naninovel` folder from the project and re-importing it from the Asset Store. Be aware that by deleting the package folder you'll lose all the engine configuration data; you can keep the configuration by migrating `Naninovel/Resources/Naninovel/Configuration` folder to the new package installation folder.
