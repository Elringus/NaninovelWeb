# Text Skipping

Text skipping feature allows to fast-forward execution of the [`@print`](/api/#print) commands, effectively skipping text revealing (printing) process.

Skip mode can be toggled using `Skip` input (`Ctrl` key by default for standalone input module) or "SKIP" button in the control panel.

By default, skip mode is only available while executing commands that was already executed in the past; e.g. if the user hadn't already read the text that is going to be printed, skip mode won't be available. This can be changed in the game settings using "Skip mode" setting.
