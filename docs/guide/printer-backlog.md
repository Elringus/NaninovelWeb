Backlog can be shown at any time during main game loop by activating `ShowBacklog` input (`Mouse ScrollWheel Up` or `B` key by default for standalone input module) or pressing "LOG" button in the control panel.

Backlog UI can be customized or completely replaced using [UI Customization](/guide/ui-customization.md) feature.
