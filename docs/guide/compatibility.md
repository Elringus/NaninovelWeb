# Requirements and compatibility

## Unity version
Due to complex nature of the engine, only the latest [LTS (long-term support)]( https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases) Unity version is officially supported. Newer versions from the TECH stream could still work, but itâ€™s not recommended to use them in production, as it could take us a while to fix possible compatibility issues.

## Platforms
All the engine features are implemented using cross-platform APIs and are expected to be compatible with all the platforms Unity can target. 

The following platforms were tested and are guaranteed to work:
* Standalone: PC, Mac, Linux
* WebGL
* iOS
* Android
* UWP (IL2CPP scripting backend only)
