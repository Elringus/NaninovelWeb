# Backgrounds 

Opposed to [characters](/guide/characters.md), backgrounds are actors used to represent a *back* layer of the scene: locations, sceneries, landscapes or anything that should always appear *behind* the characters. 

A background actor is defined with a name, appearance, visibility and transform (position, rotation, scale). It can change appearance, visibility and transform over time.

Backgrounds' behavior can be configured using `Naninovel -> Configuration -> Backgrounds` context menu; for available options see [configuration guide](/guide/configuration.md#backgrounds). The backgrounds' resources manager can be accessed using `Naninovel -> Resources -> Backgrounds` context menu.

In case you have a lot of backgrounds and it's inconvenient to assign them via editor menu, it's possible to just drop them at `Resources/Naninovel/Backgrounds` folder, grouped under folders corresponding to actor ID. Eg, to add appearances for a background actor with "MainBackground" ID, store the textures (sprites) at `Resources/Naninovel/Backgrounds/MainBackground` folder, and they'll automatically be available in the scripts.

You can additionally organize appearance resources with sub-folders, if you wish; in this case use forward slashes (`/`) when referencing them in naninovel scripts. Eg, appearance texture stored as `Resources/Naninovel/Backgrounds/MainBackground/Events/CG251` can be referenced in scripts as `Events/CG251`.

It's also possible to use [addressable asset system](/guide/resource-providers.md#addressable) to manually expose the resources. To expose an asset, assign address equal to the path you'd use to expose it via the method described above, except omit the "Resources/" part. Eg, to expose a "Beach" appearance for "MainBackground" background, assign the texture asset following address: `Naninovel/Backgrounds/MainBackground/Beach`. Be aware, that addressable provider is not used in editor by default; you can allow it by enabling `Enable Addressable In Editor` property in resource provider configuration menu.

In naninovel scripts, backgrounds are mostly controlled with [@back] command:

```nani
; Set `River` as the appearance of the main background
@back River

; Same as above, but also use a `RadialBlur` transition effect
@back River.RadialBlur
```
Backgrounds are handled a bit differently from characters to better accommodate traditional VN game flow. Most of the time you'll probably have a single background actor on scene, which will constantly transition to different appearances. To remove the hassle of repeating same actor ID in scripts, it's possible to provide only the background appearance and transition type (optional) as a nameless parameter assuming `MainBackground` actor should be affected. When this is not the case, ID of the background actor can be explicitly provided via the `id` parameter:

```nani
; Given a `CityVideo` background actor with `Night` and `Day` appearances (video clips)

; Show the video background playing day clip
@back Day id:CityVideo

; Transition to night clip with ripple effect
@back Night.Ripple id:CityVideo

; Hide the video background
@hide CityVideo
```

Main background actor record is created by default in the background resources manager and can't be renamed or deleted; however, parameters of the main background (implementation, pivot, PPU, etc) can be freely changed.

## Reference Resolution

When [camera](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-Camera.html) is rendering in orthographic mode and `Auto Correct Ortho Size` is enabled in the camera configuration, Naninovel will control the camera size based on `Reference Resolution` (set in the same menu) in order to make the background actors fill the entire screen. This ensures player won't see any black bars or distortions when the display [aspect ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_ratio_(image)) is different from the reference resolution.

![](https://i.gyazo.com/f09cd07e0841023a3f36a67d1e8949e5.png)

While for standalone (PC, Mac, Linux) builds you can limit the available aspect ratios in the [player settings](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-PlayerSettingsStandalone.html#Resolution), on web, consoles and mobiles it's not possible and the applications have to adapt for the target devices instead. 

Given the source background textures of a specific resolution, there are following options to adapt them for a different aspect ratio: resize (will distort the texture), add black bars or crop. When `Auto Correct Ortho Size` is enabled, Naninovel will automatically perform the least noticeable and distracting option â€” cropping, by modifying orthographic size of the camera. Auto correction will also handle relative actors positioning on scene, so that, for example, `pos:25` is always a quarter from the left screen border, no matter if the screen ratio is 4:3 or 21:9.

::: tip
Define reference resolution with your team before starting the work on the art assets (both characters and backgrounds). This way the artists will be able to author the assets with the correct dimensions and you won't have to edit them later.
:::

To manually handle the aspect ratio differences (eg, if you prefer to add black bars or resize the images instead of cropping), disable `Auto Correct Ortho Size` option in the camera configuration menu. You can then control orthographic size of the camera used by Naninovel with `ICameraManager` [engine service](/guide/engine-services.md).

## Poses

Each background has `Poses` property allowing to specify named states (poses).

Pose name can be used as appearance in [@back] command to apply all the parameters specified in the pose state at once, instead of specifying them individually via the command parameters.

```nani
; Given `Day` pose is defined for main background, 
; applies all the parameters specified in the pose state.
@back Day

; Same as above, but for a background actor with `City` ID
; and using `DropFade` transition over 3 seconds.
@back Day id:City transition:DropFade time:3
```

Notice, that when a pose is used as appearance, you can still override individual parameters, eg:

```nani
; Given `Day` pose is defined for main background,
; applies all the parameters specified in the pose state,
; except tint, which is overridden in the command.
@back Day tint:#ff45cb
```

## Sprite Backgrounds

Sprite implementation of the background actors is the most common and simple one; it uses a set of [texture](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Textures.html) assets wrapped over a quad mesh (sprite) to represent appearances of the background. The textures can be based on `.jpg`, `.png`, `.tiff`, `.psd` or any other image file format [supported by Unity](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ImportingTextures). 

::: tip
Choose file formats that are most comfortable for your development workflow. When building the project, Unity will automatically convert all the source resources (textures, audio, video, etc) to the formats most suitable for the target platform, so it won't make difference in which format you originally store the resources in the project. Find more information on how Unity manage project assets in the [official documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AssetWorkflow).
:::

When authoring source textures for the backgrounds, keep in mind [reference resolution](/guide/backgrounds.md#reference-resolution) set in the camera configuration. Naninovel will attempt to make the backgrounds cover the whole camera frustum by default, so make sure to size the source textures so that the aspect ratio is equal to the reference resolution.

Initial (unscaled) size of the sprite background mesh on scene depends on the [reference resolution](/guide/backgrounds.md#reference-resolution), background's `Pixel Per Unit` property (set for each background actor in the configuration menu) and source texture resolution.

To achieve best render quality and optimal performance, it's generally advised to keep the default `Pixel Per Unit` value (100) for all the backgrounds and control the desired initial background size via texture resolution. For example, given reference resolution in your game is the default `1920x1080` pixels, to make a background occupy the whole screen, set height of the background's texture (eg, by resizing it via Photoshop or other image editor) to `1080` pixels; to make another background occupy 2/3 of the screen height, set the height to `1080 * 2/3` and so on.

## Diced Sprite Backgrounds

Built with an open source [SpriteDicing](https://github.com/Elringus/SpriteDicing) package, `DicedSpriteBackground` implementation allows to significantly reduce build size and texture memory by reusing texture areas of the background sprites when the associated textures contain mostly similar data.

Diced background is very similar to diced character implementation; see the [diced characters guide](/guide/characters.html#diced-sprite-characters) for the setup and usage instructions.

## Video Backgrounds

Video backgrounds use [video clip](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-VideoClip) assets to represent the appearance. 

Video backgrounds can only be managed by editor GUI.

For the supported video formats for each platform see [Unity docs for video sources](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/VideoSources-FileCompatibility.html).

For the reference, here is the detailed video parameters of the background video clip that is used in our WebGL demo:

Depending on the target platform, it could be required to enable the transcoding in the video clip import settings.

::: example
In case having issues with achieving a seamless loop, make sure the video has exactly same starting and finishing frames and a compatible encoding setup; check our [video loop example project](https://github.com/Elringus/VideoLoop) for the reference.

### WebGL Limitations

Be aware, that on WebGL video player can only work in the streaming mode, so all the video resources will be copied to `Assets/StreamingAssets/Backgrounds` folder upon building the WebGL player. **StreamingAssets** folder will also appear in the build output directory; make sure to preserve it when publishing the build and check that your web server allows reading the data from this folder.

If you're using a video format other than mp4 (eg, webm), set the extension of the hosted files via `Video Stream Extension` property in the resource provider configuration.

## Layered Backgrounds

The layered implementation allows composing backgrounds from multiple sprites (layers) and then toggle them individually via naninovel scripts at runtime.

To create a layered background prefab, use `Create -> Naninovel -> Background -> Layered` asset context menu. Enter [prefab editing mode](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/EditingInPrefabMode.html) to compose the layers. Several layers and groups will be created by default. You can use them or delete and add your own.

The layered backgrounds are very similar to [layered characters](/guide/characters.md#layered-characters); consult the documentation for more info on how to set up and control them via naninovel scripts.

Don't forget that nameless parameter in [@back] command is expecting appearance and transition type (not ID and appearance as with [@char] command), so specify layer composition expressions in the following way:

```nani
; Given "LayeredForest" background actor
@back Group>Layer,Other/Group+Layer,-RootLayer.TransitionType id:LayeredForest
```

## Generic Backgrounds

Generic background is the most flexible background actor implementation. It's based on a prefab with a `Generic Background Behaviour` component attached to the root object. Appearance changes and all the other background parameters are routed as [Unity events](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityEvents.html) allowing to implement the behavior of the underlying object in any way you wish. 

![](https://i.gyazo.com/6483ef3e84549c1bbfbdffc6556308ea.png)

::: warn
Generic actor implementations just route events from the scenario scripts and it's up to user to implement the underlying behaviour, eg how the actor should react to the appearance or visibility change commands, whether and how it will adapt to aspect ratio changes, etc. Don't expect most of the actor-related features to work automatically with the generic implementations.
:::

To create generic background prefab from a template, use `Create -> Naninovel -> Background -> Generic` context asset menu.

Generic backgrounds are very similar to generic characters; check out a tutorial video on setting an animated 3D model as a generic character for one of the possible usage examples. Be aware, that the video is captured with an old Naninovel version and some properties and component names are different now; see the above docs for the up to date information. 

[!!HPxhR0I1u2Q]

::: tip
Unity's `Animator` component could fail to register `SetTrigger` when the game object is enabled/disabled in the same frame; in case you use `GameObject.SetActive` to handle visibility changes (as it's shown in the above tutorial), consider enabling/disabling the child objects with renderers instead.
:::

## Scene Backgrounds

You can use a [Unity scene](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CreatingScenes) as a background with scene backgrounds implementation. 

Scene backgrounds can only be managed by editor GUI; scene assets should be stored under `Assets/Scenes` project folder.

First, create a new (or move an existing) scene inside `Assets/Scenes` folder and make sure it has at least one [camera](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Camera.html). Upon loading scene background, Naninovel will assign a render texture to the first found camera in the scene. The render texture will then be assigned to a background sprite, representing the scene background inside Naninovel scene space. This way, the scene background will be able to co-exist with other background and character actors, support all the background transition effects and scale to handle various display aspect ratios. 

Make sure to position the scene objects in world space so that they don't overlap with objects from other scenes, that could potentially be loaded at the same time (eg, when referenced in a single naninovel script). Additionally, be aware, that in case a scene background object is positioned near the global space origin (`x0 y0 z0`), it could be rendered by Naninovel's main camera; to prevent this, either offset all the scene objects from the global origin, or use `Configuration -> Engine -> Override Objects Layer` to isolate Naninovel-related objects using [layers](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Layers.html).

After scene setup is complete, create a new background actor via `Naninovel -> Configuration -> Backgrounds` menu, select `SceneBackground` implementation and add the scene asset to the actor resources.

![](https://i.gyazo.com/d69159ab4d93793022018fa8d244f1aa.png)

When assigning resources for a scene background actor, corresponding scene assets should automatically be added to the [build settings](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/BuildSettings.html); in case you're getting an error that a scene asset wasn't added to the build, try adding it manually.

You can now use [@back] command to control the created scene background actor, eg:

```nani
@back SceneName id:ActorId
```

## Render to Texture

It's possible to render character and background actors of all the implementations (except generic) to a texture asset, which can then can be assigned to a custom UI, printer, material or any other compatible source. Setting up background actor render to texture is very similar to that of a character; [check the guide](/guide/characters.md#render-to-texture) fore more info and examples.
