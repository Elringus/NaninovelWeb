# Configuration
The engine configuration is stored in scriptable object assets located in `Naninovel/Resources/Naninovel/Configuration` folder. They are automatically generated when initially importing the package or when a project configuration menu is opened. 

Use `Naninovel -> Configuration` or `Edit -> Project Settings -> Naninovel` to access the configuration menu.
