# IDE Extension

IDE features, like syntax highlighting, error checking, auto-completion and interactive documentation could significantly increase productivity when writing [naninovel scripts](/guide/naninovel-scripts.md). We've made an extension for a free and open-source [VS Code editor](https://code.visualstudio.com) (available for Windows, MacOS and Linux), which provides the essential IDE support for NaniScript syntax.

## Installation

## Spell Check

To enable spell checking in the naninovel scripts, install a spell checker extension, eg. [Code Spell Check](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) and turn on the checking for `naniscript` language; see the [settings section](/guide/ide-extension.md#vs-code-settings) below for an example on how to enable naniscript language for the Code Spell Check extension.

## IDE Metadata

When adding custom commands, you may notice they're highlighted as errors. Also, available project resources and actors won't autocomplete by default. That is due to project metadata is not available to the extension. Use IDE metadata tool to automatically generate the required metadata file and enable the features.

Open the tool with `Naninovel -> Tools -> IDE Metadata` editor menu, then click "Select" button and select path to `server` folder found inside the target IDE extension; eg, for VS Code it'll be `%HOMEPATH%/.vscode/extensions/naninovel/server`, where `%HOMEPATH%` is the path to your OS user directory. Click "Generate IDE Metadata" button to generate the file at the specified path and restart IDE for changes to take effect. The custom commands should now be recognized by the IDE and autocomplete will work for the available project resources and actors. When you add or modify the commands or resources, repeat the process to update the metadata file.

::: warn
Implementing types of the custom commands should not be under `Naninovel.Commands` [namespace](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/namespaces/); otherwise, they will be recognized as built-in commands and won't be included in the generated metadata file.
:::

If you'd like to add documentation to the custom commands and/or parameters, apply `Documentation` attribute to command type and parameter fields respectively:

```csharp
[Documentation("Summary of the custom command.")]
public class CustomCommand : Command
{
    [Documentation("Summary of the custom parameter.")]
    public StringParameter CustomParameter;
}
```

## VS Code Settings

Below is the recommended user settings for VS Code to ignore Unity's autogenerated meta files, enable semantic syntax highlighting, word wrap and spell checking (given [spell check extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) is installed):

```json
{
    "files.exclude": {
        "*.meta": true
    },
    "editor.wordWrap": "on",
    "editor.semanticTokenColorCustomizations": {
        "enabled": true,
        "rules": {
            "CommentLine": { "foreground":"#5d6470", "italic": true },
            "LabelLine": "#9bc37c",
            "GenericTextLine": "#acb2be",
            "CommandLine": "#6cb2ed", 
            "CommandBody": "#6cb2ed",
            "CommandParameter": "#cd9769", 
            "ParameterValue": "#e2be7f",
            "InlinedCommand": "#6cb2ed", 
            "ScriptExpression": "#62b8c1",
            "GenericTextPrefix": "#e2be7f",
            "InvalidSymbol": "#d14e4e"
        }
    },
    "cSpell.enableFiletypes": [
        "naniscript"
    ]
}
```

You can access the user settings JSON file via `File -> Preference -> Settings` menu and clicking "Open Settings (JSON)" button in the upper-right corner of the window.

Feel free to customize the settings as you see fit.

## Video Tutorial

Below is a video tutorial on how to install, configure and use the VS Code extension; it also covers generating metadata for custom commands, resources and actors (via [inventory example project](https://github.com/Elringus/NaninovelInventory)).
